                <h1 className="faqs-header">The Program</h1>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading">What Does the Exercise Program Entail?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-one">The execise program runs for five days a week. Each week, clients will have access to  workouts that target the major muscle groups; legs, back, chest, arms, and core (abdominals). I have balanced my workout program to ensure each muscle group is well targeted. A typical week for my male clients entails two days of lower body workouts, three days of upper body workouts, and a weekly suprise challenge! For the female clients, a typical week comprises three days of lower body workouts and two days upper body workouts. These workouts will be spread out evenly across the week to prevent exhaustion and risk of injury. </p>
                <p className="faqs-answer-one-part-two">My program revolves around a disciplined and healthy lifestyle. I constantly improvise and reinvent ways of targeting the above mentioned muscle groups to increase excitement during workouts.</p>
                <p className="faqs-answer-one-part-two">Have you ever felt like your body is stagnant or have achieved plateau? Most people claim they have achieved plateau but the truth is they are yet to optimize their workouts, nutrition, and rest. When you remain consistent in my workout and nutrition plan programs, your body should start the recomposition process after six weeks!</p>
                <p className="faqs-answer-one-part-two">The goal of my workout program is to challenge you constantly and change the way you approach working out.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-two">How Do I Access the Workouts?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-second-answer">My workouts and meal plans are available on my site. You will need to login or register if you are a new user to access the each day's workout.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-three">Is There an App for the Program?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-third-answer">No. Currently, there is no app, but I am working on it</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-three">Can I Perform These Workouts From Home?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-three">Yes! My program is designed for gym-goers and those working out from home. You can perform these workouts from home, during your vacation, or when travelling. I have multiple options that will push you to work as hard as if you were in the gym.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-four">How Long Are The Workouts?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-four">A typical workout is 60 minutes. However, there are options for 30-minute workouts depending on your schedule.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-five">How Will I Perform the Workouts?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-five">Each day you can workout either at home or at the gym. I will provide short videos to describe how you can perform the exercises. You can review the videos at the gym or at home. In case you experience any discomfort, reach out to me via email or my phone number, and I will respond promptly.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-six">What Equipment Do I Need?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-six">The type of equipment depends on where you prefer to perform your workouts.</p>
                <p className="list-six">For home workouts, you will need the following:</p>
                <ul className="home-equipment">
                    <li>Dumbbells</li>
                    <li>Chair, Step, or Bench</li>
                    <li>Long resistance band</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="list-six-two">For the gym workouts, you will need the following:</p>
                <ul className="gym-equipment">
                    <li>Dumbbells</li>
                    <li>Barbells</li>
                    <li>Bench</li>
                    <li>Cable Machines</li>
                    <li>Squat Rack</li>
                    <li>Extension Machines</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-seven">Should I Warm Up and Cool Down After Each Session?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-seven">Yes. It is crucial to warm up before and cool down after working out to prevent injury and optimize performance. As you work out, your muscles are constantly under tension, and thus, it is vital to release the tension after exercise and prepare the body for the upcoming sessions.The warm-up should be at least 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching. The goal of the warm-up is to promote blood flow, raise temperature, and activate the involved muscle groups. After working out, I recommend at least 5-10 minutes of static stretching to allow your body to return to normalcy, reduce muscle soreness, and improve flexibility. Do not worry about these terms, I will provide videos and guide you on how to stretch your muscles.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-eight">Do I Need Cardio?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-eight">While cardiovascular exercises are vital for your heart health, I would recommend doing the high-intensity interval training. I have incorporated high-intensity interval training into my workout program to ensure you gain muscle and strength while losing extra fat. I strongly advise against intense cardio training before workouts as this type of training would fatigue your body before doing the provided exercises.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-nine">How Many Days Per Week Do You Recommend I Workout?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-nine">I would recommend you workout five days a week. If your schedule is too busy, I recommend working out at least three times a week. The reason for this type of training is to engage at least three major muscle groups in a week and to achieve optimal results faster. However, always listen to your body; avoid pushing yourself too much when you are fatigued. During the weekends, you can rest and spend time with your loved ones to allow your body to recover.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-ten">When Will I See The Results?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-ten">This is a very common question, and it is completely fine to inquire about the anticipated physical changes. I would like to state that there are no quick fixes to improved health; it takes time to build and maintain the discipline of working out and taking the right diet. Each person has different genetiic composition and metabolic rate that allows them to respond differently to the workout program. I cannot lie to you that I will give you "Rock hard abs in ten days." Such goals are unrealistic and fail to incorporate the discipline that goes on in achieving a healthy body. Nonetheless, I assure you that if you stick to my workout program and nutrition plan, you will achieve the best version of yourself within at least the first six months. Again, people respond to exercise differently. Some may achieve the results sooner, others later. But you will achieve the results eventually. I can assure you of that.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-subheading-eleven">But There Are So Many Others Online Programs, What Makes Yours Unique?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-answer-eleven">With my background in scholarly research, I have collected scientific evidence that indicates how to perform each exercise. My workout program is evidence-based, meaning it is supported by the latest randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis and sytematic review of randomized controlled trials. The same case applies to my meal plans. This is the reason why before we start the workout program, I recommend my clients to perform a full body composition analysis to highlight the nutritional deficiencies, body fat composition, bone density, and muscle composition. I tailor my workouts and meal plans to individual needs to ensure quicker achievement of results and optimal health outcomes and performance while reducing the risk of injury. Most importantly, I will teach you about insulin optimization and meal planning. Unlike other programs, I will show you effective ways of losing weight or gaining muscles without spending so much on food. The goal of my program is to optimize your hormones to work for your body. This way, you will achieve the best physique within a short time.</p>

                <p className="faqs-section-two-ans2">I do not believe age should restrict anyone from working out. My program can be adjusted to your physical strength and ability. If you have pre-existing health condition, you can seek medical intervention before starting</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-section-two-sub3">Do You Men or Women, or Both?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-section-two-ans3">Men and women are equally invited to be part of my program.</p>
                <h1 className="faqs-section-three">Meal Plans</h1>
                <h2 className="faqs-section-three-subh1">What is Your Meal Plan like?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-section-three-ans1">My meal plan entails balanced diet nutrition. I tailor my meal plans to the nutritional requirement of each individual. I have a way of calculating the macros and micros based on the fitness goals. In addition, I offer guide on supplementation to optimize the exercise results. I can assure you that I am following the meal plan that I provide. However, each individual may have unique meal plan based on their fitness goals. There is a wide range of recipes that are relatively low effort and use affordable ingredients to save on time and money.</p>

                <p className="faqs-section-three-ans4">No, you do not have to maintain an overly strict diet. I offer the best recommendation to fuel your body and as long as you are making sensible nutritional choices, you should be able to see results. Nonetheless, use my meal plan as a guide for the best outcomes.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-section-three-subh5">What About Cheat Meals?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-section-three-ans5">Cheat meals are optional provided you can teach your body not to overindulge and go back to square one. I would be careful of cheat meals as a beginner since your body is just starting to undergo recomposition. Besides a beginner may easily overindulge in unhealthy foods compared to an experienced athlete. Therefore, be mindful of what you consume during the weekends as overindulgence affect your fitness journey.</p>
                <h2 className="faqs-section-three-subh6">Suppose I Do Not Like the Recipe, Can I Introduce Some Recipes?</h2>
                <p className="faqs-section-three-ans6">You are always welcomed to try out new recipes that match your taste buds.
